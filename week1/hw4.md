Yes, the lack of a `break` after `case LANG_RU:` means that `make_language(LANG_RU)` results in all three boolean values set to `True`, as confirmed in [hw4.c](hw4.c):

```sh
$ gcc -Wall -o hw4 hw4.c
$ ./hw4
Code:	2
(Noun Declensions, Verb Conjugations, Grammatical Gender) -> (True, True, True)
```

*Correction:* Russian has all three, so the behavior is correct
